#* University of Brasília

## Authors: Igor Souza, Lucas Torres, André Murilo and Rafael Rodrigues

### Description:
All code was developed used a MATLAB/SIMULINK and VI-CarRealTime. The _.mat_ files available in the repository are input and simulated data. 
- Run file _ABS_TCS_pp.p_ on Matlab to generate the all the article Design and Validation of an ABS and TCS Control Strategy Applied in an Automotive Simulator Using Model-Based Design Methodology results and a few more graphics about the model performance.
