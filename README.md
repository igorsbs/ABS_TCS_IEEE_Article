# Design and Validation of an ABS and TCS Control Strategy Applied in an Automotive Simulator Using Model-Based Design Methodology

## University of Brasília

## Authors: Igor Souza, Lucas Torres, André Murilo and Rafael Rodrigues

### Description:
All code was developed used a MATLAB/SIMULINK and VI-CarRealTime. 
- The _.mat_ files available in the repository are input and simulated data.
- The _models/Sedan_ direrctory has vehicle data from Vi-CarRealTime, tire file (the one with _.tir_ extension) and a _.mat_ file containing the vehicle parameters that are loading in the MATLAB simulation. 
- Run file _ABS_TCS_pp.p_ on Matlab to generate the all the article Design and Validation of an ABS and TCS Control Strategy Applied in an Automotive Simulator Using Model-Based Design Methodology results and a few more graphics about the model performance.
